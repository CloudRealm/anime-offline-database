# Contribution guidelines

## Possible errors / problems in the database
If you find something that, in your opinion, should be changed, please submit an issue rather than creating a pull request, because the database is created by an automated process.

## Adding your project to the list of projects using this database
In case you have a project that uses this database and you want to add it to the list of projects that are using this database, create a pull request adding it to the table. Do not create an issue asking me or anyone else to add it.

+ You have to be the author/maintainer of the project that you want to add
+ Create a PR in which you add it to the table in the README.md
+ Do not change/alter anything else
+ Your project has to use this database
+ You have to have a link back to this project in the README.md of your project
+ The README.md of your project has to be in english or it must have an english translation
+ Your project has to be hosted either on github or gitlab
+ The table is sorted by project name (ascending). Add your entry accordingly.
+ Project name must match the repository name and link directly to the source code (not a project page such as YOURNAME.github.io)
+ Put your name under _Author/Maintainer_ with a link to your profile.
+ Add a meaningful description in english. The description must not be longer than 150 characters.
